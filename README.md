# Aging and Disability Services Dashboard
This is Team TANC's capstone github repo for our project's code, documentation, and related artifacts. We are building a dashboard for the City of Seattle's Aging and Disability Services to use for survey responses, impact measures, and data analysis. All the relevant code for building the dashboard is housed inside the *app* folder. Our dashboard is published 
[here](https://adscenters.shinyapps.io/dashboard).
